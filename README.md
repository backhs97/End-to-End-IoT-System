# End-to-End-IoT-System

This uses my(Harry) dataniz data and it send it to my(Harry) mongoDB database which send it to the server side also hardcoded via my url link. To use this start up the client program first in your python environment, then start up your server. The IP and port are hard coded assuming you are using one device to run this. From, there it will fill out its bst with data from the last three hours only as to not slow down the system or cause memory issue with too much data. From there you can use the client to ask specific queries. They are listed and you have to simply type a number to make it easier, anythign else will jsut tell you to use on of the other queries. THe server should respond with the correct data or if no data in the last three hours was recorded it will answer accordingly.
